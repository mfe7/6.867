\section{Summary} \label{sec:summary}

In this project, we developed an SVM classifier that got 86.3\% accuracy on pedestrian motion classification, and a LSTM classifier that got 80.4\% accuracy on the same task.
We also developed a LSTM-based motion predictor that accurately predicted future trajectories one step into the future, with a loss of $\sqrt{0.11}$m.
