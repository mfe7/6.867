\section{SVM} \label{sec:svm}

\subsection{Hyperparameters}
Trajectory sniplet length
- Each trajectory is split up into trajectory sniplets of equal length
- If Sniplet length = 1 
	- SVM equals 2D binary point classification, seen in hw 2
	- Display the decision boundary
		- save, which snips have which prediction
		- plot the prediction value
