\section{Gradient Descent} \label{sec:prob1}

In this section, we implemented Gradient Descent in Python to find the minimum of a function.

The implementation begins with an initial guess of the argument $x$ that minimizes the function.
The gradient, dfdx, is calculated analytically, and the rule next estimate of $x_{min}$ is updated according to the rule $x[i+1] = x[i] - \alpha \cdot dfdx(x[i])$.
